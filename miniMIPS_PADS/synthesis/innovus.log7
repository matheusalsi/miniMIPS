Due to this restriction, the group_path constraint is not supported directly in the constraint files which are configured in mode-specific commands such as create_constraint_mode. The current group_path entry will be ignored. You can enter the group_path constraint interactively or as part of a general command script -  where it will be interpreted as global and will be in effect for all modes.

  Clock Tree Violations Report
  ============================
  
  The clock tree has violations that CCOpt may not be able to correct due to the design settings.
  A common cause is that the violation occurs in a part of the design (e.g. an ILM) that CCOpt cannot change.
  Consider reviewing your design and relaunching CCOpt.
  
  
  Max Capacitance Violations
  --------------------------
  
  Did not meet the max_capacitance constraint of 0.000pF below the root driver for clock_tree clock at (1187.000,35.000), in power domain auto-default, which drives user don't touch net clock. Achieved capacitance of 2.751pF.
