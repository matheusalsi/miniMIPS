Due to this restriction, the group_path constraint is not supported directly in the constraint files which are configured in mode-specific commands such as create_constraint_mode. The current group_path entry will be ignored. You can enter the group_path constraint interactively or as part of a general command script -  where it will be interpreted as global and will be in effect for all modes.

CTS treats D-pins and I/O pins as non-synchronous pins by default.
If you want to change the behavior, you need to use the SetDPinAsSync
or SetIoPinAsSync statement in the clock tree specification file,
or use the setCTSMode -traceDPinAsLeaf {true|false} command,
or use the setCTSMode -traceIoPinAsLeaf {true|false} command
before specifyClockTree command.

Use setCTSMode to change default values.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) Pin capacitance check

Max Cap Limit Checks
============================================================
**WARN: (IMPCK-6003):	The input capacitance of cell ICP(PAD) is 2.751pF, (timing library IO_CELLS_5V_MOS5ST_typ_1_80V_4_50V_25C is 2.751pF, macro-model definition is 0.000pF), which may make it difficult to meet max buf transition constraint. Number of gated instances having this cell type = 1.

Max placement distance Checks
============================================================
**WARN: (IMPCK-6325):	Found an instance pin IOPADS_INST/PAD_clock_I/PAD on clock clock that has no availble placement location near it. 
The nearest available placement location to place a buffer is at (1207.71,  277.55), which is 20.97 microns away from the pin.
It may be difficult to drive this pin with an acceptable transition time from this location.
Please check and make sure there are availble placement locations near this instance pin.
