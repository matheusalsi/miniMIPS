***** !! NOTE !! *****

CTS treats D-pins and I/O pins as non-synchronous pins by default.
If you want to change the behavior, you need to use the SetDPinAsSync
or SetIoPinAsSync statement in the clock tree specification file,
or use the setCTSMode -traceDPinAsLeaf {true|false} command,
or use the setCTSMode -traceIoPinAsLeaf {true|false} command
before specifyClockTree command.

Switching SI Aware to true by default in postroute mode   

**ERROR: (IMPOPT-7027):	The analysis mode needs to be set to 'OCV' in post route stage for post route timing & optimization. To avoid this message & allow post route steps to proceed set 'set_db timing_analysis_type onChipVariation'. It is also recommended to set 'timing_analysis_cppr both' alongside this to remove clock re-convergence pessimism for both setup and hold modes.

**WARN: (SDF-808):	The software is currently operating in a high performance mode which optimizes the handling of multiple timing arcs between input and output pin pairs. With the current settings, the SDF file generated will contain the same delay information for all of these arcs. To have the SDF recalculated with explicit pin pair data, you should use the option '-recompute_parallel_arcs'. This setting is recommended for generating SDF for functional  simulation applications.
