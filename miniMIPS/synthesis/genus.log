Outputs without clocked external delays

The following primary outputs have no clocked external delays.  As a result the 
timing paths leading to the ports have no timing constraints derived from clock 
waveforms.  The'external_delay' command is used to create new external delays.

Scan mapping status report
==========================
    Scan mapping: converting flip-flops that pass TDRC.
    Scan mapping: bypassed.  You have to either 1) set attribute 'dft_scan_map_mode' to 'tdrc_pass' and run 'check_dft_rules' or 2) set attribute 'dft_scan_map_mode' to 'force_all'.

    Scan mapping bypassed because no TDRC data is available: either command 'check_dft_rules' has not been run or TDRC data has been subsequently invalidated.
